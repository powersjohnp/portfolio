Examples from code I have written for research projects  

### MATLAB  
task_pseudorandomization.m  
This script performs trial order pseudorandomization for a research task with a complex design, in which many conditions had to be balanced and ordered in very specific ways. It was called at the beginning of a task script, when research participants completed said task while undergoing fMRI scanning of brain activity.  

### BASH  
data_extraction.sh  
This script extracts data from log files that were generated while participants completed a research task in an MRI scanner. These data are then reconstructed into files that will be used for analyses of brain activity.
