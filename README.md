Examples from code I have written for research projects  

### MATLAB  
task_pseudorandomization.m  
This script performs trial order pseudorandomization for an experimental task with a complex design, in which many conditions had to be balanced and ordered in very specific ways. It was called at the beginning of a task script, when research participants completed said task while undergoing fMRI scanning of brain activity.
